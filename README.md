# mortgage_decision
Mid-term program in C++ to determine user worthiness for mortgage

Another simple program in C++ that allows users to input a score and then determines whether the score the user gave qualifies the user for a mortgage or not. The primary challenge with this project was the use of a reference pointer in getScore.
